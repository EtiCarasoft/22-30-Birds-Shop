UITxTinicial.uitext,\nYou look at the photo of the young Felicia -a blonde girl with big brown eyes- before entering. Behind the counter, a short man points a finger at the curtain at the rear of the room. You move between the old wooden cages, only the few shafts of moonlight guide your path and the shadows grow longer and more sinister the further you proceed into the shop. There is just enough light to make out the inhabitants of the cages - strange colourful birds. You pull the red curtain aside and descend down a flight of stairs that ends at a red wooden door. You knock four times and the door opens, an oriental man stands in the door way blocking your entry. He looks you up and down before stepping to one side and gesturing for you to enter.  Once inside he closes the door behind you, then opens a second door.\n\nIt takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the light, several musicians are playing a lively Charleston at the back, while a young couple dances in the center of the small basement. On your left an exquisit looking bar catches your attention and you smack your lips - you do feel a little parched.\n\nYou look for an opening at the crowded bar and just as you find one the bartender slides you a bourbon, it has two ice cubes in it. He points to a gentleman sitting at the corner of the bar:\n\n<i>- On behalf of Mr. Ford. - </i>\n\nYou raise the glass as gesture of gratitude and head towards him, manouvering through the crowd. Previously they seemed to act as if you did not exist, but now they seem to form a corridor as you walk, guiding you to your destination, though none of them even look at you as you pass.\n\nYou greet Mr. Ford with a smile and he responds by raising his glass and taking a sip. You bring the drink to your lips...
